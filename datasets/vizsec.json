    "abstract":"We present an approach to user re-authentication based on the data collected from the computer's mouse device. Our underlying hypothesis is that one can successfully model user behavior on the basis of user-invoked mouse movements. Our implemented system raises an alarm when the current behavior of user X, deviates sufficiently from learned \"normal\" behavior of user X. We apply a supervised learning method to discriminate among k users. Our empirical results for eleven users show that we can differentiate these individuals based on their mouse movement behavior with a false positive rate of 0.43% and a false negative rate of 1.75%. Nevertheless, we point out that analyzing mouse movements alone is not sufficient for a stand-alone user reauthentication system. Copyright 2004 ACM.",

While much work has been done on active and passive operating systems detection, little has been done on fingerprinting the specific tools used by attackers. This research explores the application of several visualization techniques and their usefulness toward identification of attack tools, without the typical automated intrusion detection system's signatures and statistical anomalies. These visualizations were tested using a wide range of popular network security tools and the results show that in many cases, the specific tool can be identified and provides intuition that many classes of zero-day attacks can be rapidly detected and analyzed using similar techniques.

    "abstract":"Today's system administrators, burdened by rapidly increasing network activity, must quickly perceive the security state of their networks, but they often have only text-based tools to work with. These tools often provide no overview to help users grasp the big-picture. Our interviews with administrators have revealed that they need visualization tools; thus, we present VISUAL (Visual Information Security Utility for Administration Live), a network security visualization tool that allows users to see communication patterns between their home (or internal) networks and external hosts. VISUAL is part of our Network Eye security visualization architecture, also described in this paper. We have designed and tested a new computer security visualization that gives a quick overview of current and recent communication patterns in the monitored network to the users. Many tools can detect and show fan-out and fan-in, but VISUAL shows network events graphically, in context. Visualization helps users comprehend the intensity of network events more intuitively than text-based tools can. VISUAL provides insight for networks with up to 2,500 home hosts and 10,000 external hosts, shows the relative activity of hosts, displays them in a constant relative position, and reveals the ports and protocols used.

To counteract these drawbacks an interactive detection system based on simple Bayesian statistics combined with a visualisation component is proposed, in the hope that this lets the operator better understand how exactly the intrusion detection system is operating. The resulting system is applied to the log of a webserver. The combination proved to be effective. The Bayesian classifier was reasonably effective in learning to differentiate between benign and malicious accesses, and the visualisation component enabled the operator to discern when the intrusion detection system was correct in its output and when it was not, and to take corrective action, re-training the system interactively, until the desired level of performance was reached.

    "abstract":"We describe a framework for managing network attack graph complexity through interactive visualization, which includes hierarchical aggregation of graph elements. Aggregation collapses non-overlapping subgraphs of the attack graph to single graph vertices, providing compression of attack graph complexity. Our aggregation is recursive (nested), according to a predefined aggregation hierarchy. This hierarchy establishes rules at each level of aggregation, with the rules being based on either common attribute values of attack graph elements or attack graph connectedness. The higher levels of the aggregation hierarchy correspond to higher levels of abstraction, providing progressively summarized visual overviews of the attack graph. We describe rich visual representations that capture relationships among our semantically-relevant attack graph abstractions, and our views support mixtures of elements at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. While it would be possible to allow arbitrary nested aggregation of graph elements, it is better to constrain aggregation according to the semantics of the network attack problem, i.e., according to our aggregation hierarchy. The aggregation hierarchy also makes efficient automatic aggregation possible. We introduce the novel abstraction of protection domain as a level of the aggregation hierarchy, which corresponds to a fully-connected subgraph (clique) of the attack graph. We avoid expensive detection of attack graph cliques through knowledge of the network configuration, i.e. protection domains are predefined. While significant work has been done in automatically generating attack graphs, this is the first treatment of the management of attack graph complexity for interactive visualization. Overall, computation in our framework has worst-case quadratic complexity, but in practice complexity is greatly reduced because users generally interact with (often negligible) subsets of the attack graph. We apply our framework to a real network, using a software system we have developed for generating and visualizing network attack graphs. Copyright 2004 ACM.",

Some of these attacks have exploited vulnerabilities for which advisories had been issued and for which patches and detection signatures were available. It is increasingly apparent, however, that such prevention and detection mechanisms are inadequate, and that the attacker's time to exploit is shrinking relative to the defender's ability to learn of a new attack and patch systems or update intrusion detection signatures. We introduce visual, scalable techniques to detect phenomena such as distributed denial-of-service attacks and worms. It is hoped that these new approaches will enable detection of such events at an early stage and enable local response actions even before the publication of advisories about a new vulnerability and the availability of patches.

Because of the absence of ground truth about known attacks, we propose an unsupervised, anomaly-based method for automatically distinguishing alarms that are potentially generated by malicious insider attacks, from the repetitive and temporally structured legitimate system-administration alarms. The majority of previous work in this area has used heuristic and statistical filtering techniques to discard a relatively large proportion of alarms in the final presentation to the security analyst, which is a potentially dangerous practice. Instead, we demonstrate the use of a typicality measure to visualize the apparent risk associated with alarms, while retaining information about the temporal context of the entire alarm stream for the analyst to view. The relevance of the statistical method is examined by comparing the results to a set of analyst-curated alarms from an operational environment. Copyright 2004 ACM.",

Often, important details are overlooked and it is difficult to get an overall picture of what is occurring in the network by manually traversing textual alarm logs.

Alarm data is presented in an overview where system administrators can get a general sense of network activity and easily detect anomalies. They then have the option of zooming and drilling down for details. The information is presented with local network IP (Internet Protocol) addresses plotted over multiple yaxes to represent the location of alarms. Time on the x-axis is used to show the pattern of the alarms and variations in color encode the severity and amount of alarms. Based on our system administrator requirements study, this graphical layout addresses what system administrators need to see, is faster and easier than analyzing text logs, and uses visualization techniques to effectively scale and display the data. With this design, we have built a tool that effectively uses operational alarm log data generated on the Georgia Tech campus network.

IDtk was developed through a user-centered design process, in which we identiTed design guidelines to support ID users. ID analysts protect their networks by searching for evidence of attacks in ID system output, Trewall and system logs, and other complex, textual data sources. Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of information visualization techniques offers a valuable addition to the toolkit of the ID analyst. Several visualization techniques for ID have been developed, but few usability or Teld studies have been completed to assess the needs of ID analysts and the usability and usefulness of these tools. We intended to Tll this gap by applying a user-centered design process in the development and evaluation of IDtk, a 3D, glyph-based visualization tool that gives the user maximum texibility in setting up how the visualization display represents ID data. The user can also customize whether the display is a simple, high-level overview to support monitoring, or a more complex 3D view allowing for viewing the data from multiple angles and thus supporting analysis and diagnosis.

In particular, many tools exist that detect network scans or visualize them at a high level, but not very many tools exist that are capable of categorizing and analyzing network scans. This paper presents a means of facilitating the process of characterization by using visualization and statistics techniques to analyze the patterns found in the timing of network scans through a method of continuous improvement in measures that serve to separate the components of interest in the characterization so the user can control separately for the effects of attack tool employed, performance characteristics of the attack platform, and the effects of network routing in the arrival patterns of hostile probes.

    "abstract":"Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies, 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns, 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow. IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the Histographs[23] technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis. We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed attacks. © 2005 IEEE.",

In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the Time-based Network traffic Visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes \"normal\" on a particular network. © 2005 IEEE.",

In any application where a polar plot would be useful but distortion of the data must be avoided, or where it is important to avoid some markers from being occluded by others, root polar coordinates may be useful. Our approach provides: (1) a novel adaptation of polar coordinates that overcomes plotting distortion, (2) a means of plotting network data in near real-time without complex layout optimization, (3) an algorithm that reduces occlusion of plotted points while maintaining consistent placement, and (4) an empirical comparison of Cartesian vs. polar plots. © 2005 IEEE.",

Security engineers must complete two different tasks, that of Discovery of a pattern, and that of Searching for a pattern in a data set. Current security visualizations do not aid the user in creating symbolic rules that represent visual patterns. Transforming visual patterns to symbolic rules requires effort by the security engineer and detracts from their main task of discovering interesting patterns. In this paper we describe the idea of Closing-The-Loop - a system where symbolic rules are created from visual patterns. © 2005 IEEE.",

To facilitate this analysis, we present a novel visualization technique for comparing and navigating among 600-1000+ such objects at one time. While the visualization technique alone has powerful application for both directed and undirected exploration of many classes of binary objects, we chose to study network packets. To increase effectiveness, we strengthened the visualization technique with novel, domain-specific semantic zooming, interactive encoding and dynamic querying capabilities. We present results and lessons learned from implementing these techniques and from studying both malicious and non-malicious network packets. Our results indicate that the information visualization system we present is an efficient and effective way to compare large numbers of network packets, visually examine their payloads and navigate to areas of interest within large network datasets. © 2005 IEEE.",

Using these systems, it is difficult to understand the source of attack, the diffusion of the attack, or the relation between the target and the source of the attack. This paper described a method for visualizing cyber threats by using 2-dimensional matrix representation of IP addresses. The advantages of this method are that: (1) the logical distance of IP addresses is represented intuitively, (2) Internet address space is visualized economically, (3) macroscopic information (Internet level) and microscopic information (local level) are visualized simultaneously. By using this visualization framework, propagation of the Welchia worm and the Sasser.D worm are visualized. © 2005 IEEE.",

This paper describes a number of new attack graph visualization techniques, each having certain desirable properties and offering different perspectives for solving different kinds of problems. Moreover, the techniques we describe can be applied not only separately, but can also be combined into coordinated attack graph views. We apply improved visual clustering to previously described network protection domains (attack graph cliques), which reduces graph complexity and makes the overall attack flow easier to understand. We also visualize the attack graph adjacency matrix, which shows patterns of network attack while avoiding the clutter usually associated with drawing large graphs. We show how the attack graph adjacency matrix concisely conveys the impact of network configuration changes on attack graphs. We also describe a novel attack graph filtering technique based on the interactive navigation of a hierarchy of attack graph constraints. Overall, our techniques scale quadratically with the number of machines in the attack graph. © 2005 IEEE.",

    "abstract":"Information visualization has proven to be a valuable tool for working more effectively with complex data and maintaining situational awareness in demanding operational domains. Unfortunately, many applications of visualization technology fall short of expectations because the technology is used inappropriately: the wrong tool applied in the wrong way. A study of visualization techniques as applied to one particularly demanding area - information assurance - leads to the conclusion that there is a proper and formal way to approach designing visualization techniques for maintaining situational awareness in complex domains. Visualization techniques should be specifically designed or selected to align with one of the three identified stages of situational awareness - perception, comprehension, or projection - and with one of five standard uses of visualization: monitoring, inspecting, exploring, forecasting, or communicating. Greater value can be realized by selecting the right visualization technique to focus on each operational task, rather than searching for a single allencompassing solution to fit every need. Examples of how visualizations can be used to support specific tasks of IA analysis are presented, with examples based on a review of available literature, a formal cognitive task analysis performed by the authors, and lessons learned from direct experience with developing IA visualizations and training analysts in their use. © 2005 IEEE.",

One problem with current implementations, however, is the sheer number of alerts they can generate, many of which tend to be false alarms. This drawback makes effective use of such systems a challenging task. In this paper we explore three-dimensional approaches to visualizing network intrusion detection system alerts and aggregated network statistics in order to provide the system administrator with a better picture of the events occurring on his or her network. While some research has been done using two-dimensional concepts, 3D approaches have not received much attention with regard to detecting network intrusions. Evaluation of our visualizations using the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation data set demonstrates the potential benefit of utilizing the third dimension. We show how a number of attack types in the data set generate visual evidence of abnormal activity that a security administrator might use as motivation for further investigation. © 2005 IEEE.",

    "abstract":"The detection of known and unknown attacks usually requires the interpretation and presentation of very large amounts of time-oriented security data. Using regular means for displaying the data, such as text or tables, is often ineffective. Furthermore, displaying only raw data is not sufficient, because the security expert is still required to derive meaningful conclusions from large amounts of data. In addition, in many cases (e.g., for detecting a virus spreading in the network), an aggregated view of multiple network devices is more effective than a view of each individual device. In this paper we propose an intelligent interface used by a distributed architecture that was described in our previous work, specific to the tasks of knowledge-based interpretation, summarization, query, visualization and interactive exploration of large numbers of time-oriented data. In order to support the interpretation and computation process, we provide automated mechanisms that perform derivation of context-specific, interval-based abstract interpretations (also known as Temporal Abstractions) from raw time-stamped security data, by using a domain-specific knowledge-base (e.g., a period of 5 hours, during the night, of a high number of FTP connections within the context of No User Activity, which might indicate the existence of a Trojan in the computer). The proposed visualization tool includes several functionalities for querying, visualization and exploration of both raw and abstracted time-oriented security data regarding single and multiple network devices.

The visualization component incorporates the detection results and provides an effective mechanism to illustrate abnormal topology patterns and locate fake identities.

Contributing to the two parent communities, namely computer security and visualization, by integrating visualization components into existing security tools and feeding back successful visualization designs.

    "abstract":"Owing to the inter-domain aspects of BGP routing, it is difficult to correlate information across multiple domains in order to analyze the root cause of the routing outages. We present BGP Eye, a tool for visualization-aided root-cause analysis of BGP anomalies. In contrast to previous approaches, BGP Eye performs real-time analysis of BGP anomalies through hierarchical analysis. First, BGP updates are clustered to obtain BGP events that are more representative of an anomaly. These events are then correlated across all border routers to ascertain the extent of the anomaly. Furthermore, BGP Eye provides both the capability to analyze BGP anomalies from an Internet-Centric View through multiple vantage points as well as from a Home-Centric View of a particular Autonomous System. We present the capability for scalable and real-time root-cause analysis provided by BGP Eye through the analysis of two very different anomalies. First, we provide an Internet-Centric view from AS568 of the routing outages during the spread of the Slammer Worm on January 25th, 2003. Second, we provide a Home-Centric view from AS6458 of the routing outages caused by the inadvertent prefix hijacking by AS9121 on December 24th, 2004. Copyright 2006 ACM.",

This proliferation of e-services has put large quantities of consumer private information in the hands of the service providers, who in many cases have mishandled the information, either intentionally or unintentionally, to the detriment of consumer privacy. As a result, government bodies have put in place privacy legislation that spells out a consumer's privacy rights and how consumer private information is to be handled. Providers are required to comply with such privacy legislation. This paper proposes visualization as a tool that can be used by security or privacy analysts to understand how private information flows within and between provider organizations, as a way of identifying vulnerabilities that can lead to non-compliance. A model of private information flow and a graphical notation for visualizing this flow are proposed. An application example of using the notation to identify privacy vulnerabilities is given.

In this paper we introduce an original visualization design which combine 3D and 2D representations of the network traffic and activity. Both representations are based on the same interactive grid representation of the network space and are linked together as they provide complementary functionalities.The 3D representation provides an overview of the communications between several network zones and the 2D representation provides a detailed view of selected parts of the 3D one.

The CTA collected data from CND analysts about their analytic goals, workflow, tasks, types of decisions made, data sources used to make those decisions, cognitive demands, tools used and the biggest challenges that they face. The effort focused on understanding how CND analysts inspect raw data and build their comprehension into a diagnosis or decision, especially in cases requiring data fusion and correlation across multiple data sources. This paper covers three of the findings from the CND CTA: (1) the hierarchy of data created as the analytical process transforms data into security situation awareness; (2) the definition and description of different CND analysis roles; and (3) the workflow that analysts and analytical organizations engage in to produce analytic conclusions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

NetBytes has a set of interactive features which help to deal with the problems associated with displaying a 3D graph on a 2D screen. First, NetBytes offers a \"selector\" mode which allows the user to highlight specific ports (or times) on the graph using a slider and snap buttons. From the selector, the user can launch a set of 2D graphs (Bytes vs. Time and Bytes vs. Ports) to acquire more detailed information about the host with less clutter. Lastly, the user is able to rotate the 3D graph in any direction to mitigate occlusion. The long term objectives of this work include the integration of the NetBytes Viewer with complementary visualizations of the overall network. This application will integrate with a larger network analysis tool and be utilized as a drill-down mechanism. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

We present a new visualization of a computer network for security purposes by approaching the problem from a service-oriented perspective. This approach involves a node graph visualization where each node is represented as a compound glyph, which gives details about the network activity for the specific node based upon its service usage. Furthermore, we visualize temporal activity using time slicing techniques in the compound glyph to give more details about the network and allow interactive controls for an administrator to actively monitor a network in order to react to security events quickly.

At the United States Air Force Academy Center for Information Security, we have been working on a new algorithm, BBC, which is based on a new type of coding theory known as concurrent codes that is resistant to traditional jamming techniques. While the formal definition and proofs of concurrent codes can be daunting, the algorithm's effectiveness can be easily conveyed and appreciated through visual demonstration.

    "abstract":"Monitoring host behavior in a network is one of the most essential tasks in the fields of network monitoring and security since more and more malicious code in the wild internet constantly threatens the network infrastructure. In this paper, we present a visual analytics tool that visualizes network host behavior through positional changes in a two-dimensional space using a force-directed graph layout algorithm. The tool's interaction capabilities allow for visual exploration of network traffic over time and are demonstrated using netflow data as well as IDS alerts. Automatic accentuation of hosts with highly variable traffic results in fast hypothesis generation and confirmation of suspicious host behavior. By triggering the behavior graph from the HNMap tool, we were able to monitor more abstract network entities. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "abstract":"To effectively identify and respond to cyber threats, computer security analysts must understand the scale, motivation, methods, source, and target of an attack. Central to developing this situational awareness is the analyst's world knowledge that puts these attributes in context. What known exploits or new vulnerabilities might an anomalous traffic pattern suggest? What organizational, social, or geopolitical events help forecast or explain attacks and anomalies? Few visualization tools support creating, maintaining, and applying this knowledge of the threat landscape. Through a series of formative workshops with practicing security analysts, we have developed a visualization approach inspired by the human process of contextualization; this system, called NUANCE, creates evolving behavioral models of network actors at organizational and regional levels, continuously monitors external textual information sources for themes that indicate security threats, and automatically determines if behavior indicative of those threats is present on a network. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "abstract":"Attack graphs for large enterprise networks improve security by revealing critical paths used by adversaries to capture network assets. Even with simplification, current attack graph displays are complex and difficult to relate to the underlying physical networks. We have developed a new interactive tool intended to provide a simplified and more intuitive understanding of key weaknesses discovered by attack graph analysis. Separate treemaps are used to display host groups in each subnet and hosts within each treemap are grouped based on reachability, attacker privilege level, and prerequisites. Users position subnets themselves to reflect their own intuitive grasp of network topology. Users can also single-step the attack graph to successively add edges that cascade to show how attackers progress through a network and learn what vulnerabilities or trust relationships allow critical steps. Finally, an integrated reachability display demonstrates how filtering devices affect host-to-host network reachability and influence attacker actions. This display scales to networks with thousands of hosts and many subnets. Rapid interactivity has been achieved because of an efficient C++ computation engine (a program named NetSPA) that performs attack graph and reachability computations, while a Java application manages the display and user interface. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Where human assessment disagrees with the alert output, explanations are sought by analysing the detection algorithms. The Snort and Bro algorithms are based on counting unique connection attempts to destination addresses and ports. For Snort, notable false positive and false negative cases result due to a grossly oversimplified method of counting unique destination addresses and ports. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

In this paper, we present design principles for file analysis which support meaningful investigation when there is little or no knowledge of the underlying file format, but are flexible enough to allow integration of additional semantic information, when available. We also present results from the implementation of a visual reverse engineering system based on our analysis. We validate the efficacy of both our analysis and our system with case studies depicting analysis use cases where a hex editor would be of limited value. Our results indicate that visual approaches help analysts rapidly identify files, analyze unfamiliar file structures, and gain insights that inform and complement the current suite of tools currently in use. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

It allows users to perform \"what-if\" experiments including adding new zero-day attacks, following recommendations to patch software vulnerabilities, and changing the attacker starting location to analyze external and internal attackers. Users can also compute and view metrics of assets captured versus attacker effort to compare the security of complex networks. For adversaries with three skill levels, it is possible to create graphs of assets captured versus attacker steps and the number of unique exploits required. GARNET is implemented as a Java application and is built on top of an existing C++ engine that performs reachability and attack graph computations.

These attack graphs, however, are often complex and difficult to comprehend fully, and a human user may find it problematic to reach appropriate configuration decisions. This paper presents methodologies that can 1) automatically identify portions of an attack graph that do not help a user to understand the core security problems and so can be trimmed, and 2) automatically group similar attack steps as virtual nodes in a model of the network topology, to immediately increase the understandability of the data. We believe both methods are important steps toward improving visualization of attack graphs to make them more useful in configuration management for large enterprise networks. We implemented our methods using one of the existing attack-graph toolkits. Initial experimentation shows that the proposed approaches can 1) significantly reduce the complexity of attack graphs by trimming a large portion of the graph that is not needed for a user to understand the security problem, and 2) significantly increase the accessibility and understandability of the data presented in the attack graph by clearly showing, within a generated visualization of the network topology, the number and type of potential attacks to which each host is exposed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Through monitoring systems, attacks can be detected and analyzed to gain knowledge of how to better protect the network in the future. In the scope of this paper, we present a system to analyze NetFlow data using a relational database system. NetFlow records are linked with alerts from an intrusion detection system to enable efficient exploration of suspicious activity within the monitored network. Within the system, the monitored network is mapped to a TreeMap visualization, the attackers are arranged at the borders and linked using splines parameterized with prefix information.

Yet the problem remains that if the visualization provides no insight into the network events that warrant further consideration, then the administrator must go back to the data to determine what should be visualized next. This is a critical issue given the amount of network data under consideration, only a small portion of which can be examined at any one time. In this paper we present a visualization that provides context for network visualizations by providing a high-level view of network events. Our visualization not only provides a starting point for network visualization, but also reduces the cognitive burden of the analyst by providing a visual paradigm for both the filtering of network data and the selection of network data to drill into and visualize with alternative representations. We demonstrate, through the use of a case study, that our visualization can provide motivation for further investigation into anomalous network activity. ©2009 IEEE.",

    "abstract":"Passwords are a fundamental security vulnerability in many systems. Several researchers have investigated the tradeoff between password memorability versus resiliency to cracking and have looked at alternative systems such as graphical passwords and biometrics. To create stronger passwords, many systems enforce rules regarding the required length and types of characters passwords must contain. Another suggested approach is to use passphrases to combat dictionary attacks. One common \"trick\" used to remember passwords that conform to complex rules is to select a pattern of keys on the keyboard. While appearing random, the pattern is easy to remember. The purpose of this research was to investigate how often patterns are used, whether patterns could be classified into common categories, and whether those categories could be used to attack and defeat pattern-based passwords. Visualization techniques were used to collect data and assist in pattern categorization. The approach successfully identified two out of eleven passwords in a real-world password file that were not discovered with a traditional dictionary attack. This paper will present the approach used to collect and categorize patterns, and describe the resulting attack method that successfully identified passwords in a live system. ©2009 IEEE.",

Our initial work on the direct visualization of firewall configurations showed the limitations of visualizing just the range of packets that can be accepted. To visually capture the interactions between rules, we introduce the concept of a \"created void.\" Created voids capture the information about destructive interactions between rules in a firewall ruleset, where an overlap between a deny rule prevents that packet from reaching an accept rule later in the ruleset. We present a lossless five-dimensional visualization of the convex solid decomposition of the set of acceptable packets from a firewall configuration, augmented with visual representations of created voids. This interactive visualization is embedded in a simple firewall ruleset editor, allowing the user to investigate the effect of changes in the ruleset. ©2009 IEEE.",

    "abstract":"Geographical displays are commonly used for visualizing wide-spread malicious behavior of Internet hosts. Placing dots on a world map or coloring regions by the magnitude of activity often results in cluttered maps that invariably emphasize population-dense metropolitan areas in developed countries where Internet connectivity is highest. To uncover atypical regions, it is necessary to normalize activity by the local computer population. This paper presents EMBER (Extreme Malicious Behavior viewER), an analysis and display of malicious activity at the city level. EMBER uses a metric called Standardized Incidence Rate (SIR) that is the number of hosts exhibiting malicious behavior per 100,000 available hosts. This metric relies on available data that (1) Maps IP addresses to geographic locations, (2) Provides current city populations, and (3) Provides computer usage penetration rates. Analysis of several months of suspicious source IP addresses from DShield identifies cities with extremely high and low malicious activity rates on a day-by-day basis. In general, cities in a few Eastern European countries have the highest SIRs whereas cities in Japan and South Korea have the lowest. Many of these results are consistent with news reports describing local cyber security policies. A simulation that models how malware spreads preferentially within cities to local IP addresses replicates the long-tailed distribution of city SIRs that was found in the data. This simulation result agrees with past analyses in suggesting that malware often preferentially spreads to local regions with already high levels of malicious activity. © 2010 ACM.",

Our visualization tool, ENAVis (Enterprise Network Activities Visualization), quantifies and presents these important changes and dynamics essential to network operators through a visually appealing and highly interactive manner. Through novel graph construction and transformation, such as network connectivity graphs, MDS graphs, bipartite graphs, and similarity graphs, we demonstrate how similarity\/dynamics can be effectively visualized to provide insight with regards to network understanding. © 2010 ACM.",

That is, each caller is presented with a graphical representation of the key and through verbal interaction (i.e., side-channel authentication) they describe what they see. If they agree, the key is authenticated and the secure media session continues. The strength of the approach lies in the vocal recognition of the callers, and their ability to confirm the image displayed by their system. The necessary degree of visual recognition is achieved by using basic shapes, color and count. People, regardless of language or age, can easily identifying these images. Our experience shows that they can communicate what they see with little effort and terminate the call when they differ. We believe that this approach reverses the current trend in security to divest users from the underlying cryptographic principles supporting secure systems by abstracting these principles to a comprehensible and visual form.

    "abstract":"In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of using graphical methods for isolating the differences between common application protocols - -both in their transient and steady-state behavior. Specifically, we take advantage of the observation that many Internet application protocols proscribe a very specific series of client\/server interactions that are clearly visible in the sizes and timing of packets produced at the network layer and below. We show how so-called \"visual motifs\" built on these features can be used to assist a human operator to recognize application protocols in unidentified traffic. From a practical point of view, visual traffic classification can be used, for example, for anomaly detection to verify that all traffic to a web server on TCP port 80 does indeed exhibit the characteristic behavior patterns of HTTP, or for misuse detection to find unauthorized servers or to identify traffic generated by prohibited applications. We present our technique for building a classifier based on the notion of visual motifs and report on our experience using this technique to automatically classify on-the-wire behavioral patterns from network flow data collected from a campus network. Specifically, we analyze over 1 billion flows corresponding to over 5 million sessions on nearly 200 distinct ports and show that our approach achieves high recall and precision. © 2010 ACM.",

    "abstract":"Plentiful, complex, and dynamic data make understanding the state of an enterprise network difficult. Although visualization can help analysts understand baseline behaviors in network traffic and identify off-normal events, visual analysis systems often do not scale well to operational data volumes (in the hundreds of millions to billions of transactions per day) nor to analysis of emergent trends in real-time data. We present a system that combines multiple, complementary visualization techniques coupled with in-stream analytics, behavioral modeling of network actors, and a high-throughput processing platform called MeDICi. This system provides situational understanding of real-time network activity to help analysts take proactive response steps. We have developed these techniques using requirements gathered from the government users for which the tools are being developed. By linking multiple visualization tools to a streaming analytic pipeline, and designing each tool to support a particular kind of analysis (from high-level awareness to detailed investigation), analysts can understand the behavior of a network across multiple levels of abstraction. © 2010 ACM.",

A CMV visualization consisting of a node-link diagram, scatterplot, and time histogram is described that allows interactive analysis from different perspectives, as some network anomalies can only be identified through joint features in the provided spaces. Spectral analysis methods are integrated to provide visual cues that allow identification of malicious nodes. An adjacency-based method is developed to generate the time histogram, which allows users to select time ranges in which suspicious activity occurs. Data from Sybil attacks in simulated wireless networks is used as the test bed for the system. The results and discussions demonstrate that intrusion detection can be achieved with a few iterations of CMV exploration. Quantitative results are collected on the accuracy of our approach and comparisons are made to single domain exploration and other high-dimensional projection methods. We believe that this approach can be extended to anomaly detection in general networks, particularly to Internet networks and social networks. © 2010 ACM.",

While automatically monitoring the network for slow or failing components has become common practice, defining an acceptable state of the system is only possible to a very limited extent and thus exploratory analysis tasks by real human analysts complement the analysis process. However, this is a problem of scale since it is infeasible to manually inspect thousands of hosts without proper visual support for the tasks of gaining an overview, focusing and retrieving details on demand. In this paper we present a design study to enable visual support for monitoring large IP spaces. In particular, the presented system features 1) a scalable glyph representation in the style of a clock for giving an overview of the activity over time of thousands of hosts in the network, 2) subnet and port views for focusing the analysis to a particular subset of the data and 3) detailed pixel matrix visualizations for interpreting concrete traffic patterns. Furthermore, the tool's feedback loop, which is implemented through interaction capabilities, allows for retrieving new details, refocusing and enhancing of the overview. © 2011 ACM.",

Due to their relevance and central location in the network, their programming logic often survives several generations of administrators and hardware. Understanding the logic behind a firewall configuration is thus an important but challenging task for a network administrator. In general, there is a tendency to add new rules while old rules are only rarely changed or removed due to unexpected consequences in the network. In this paper we present a visualization tool to support the network administrator in this complex task of understanding firewall rule sets and object group definitions. The tool consists of a hierarchical sunburst visualization, which logically groups rules or object groups according to their common characteristics, a color-linked configuration editor and classical tree view components for rules and object groups. All these components are interactively linked to enable both exploratory and hypotheses testing tasks aimed at understanding the complex functionality of a firewall configuration. To verify our design, we present two case studies on the analysis of rule usage and on nested object groups and collected feedback from five firewall administrators. Copyright 2012 ACM.",

This visualization technique, the Cyber Command Gauge Cluster (CCGC), allows analysts to review the state of the network and locate potentially problematic anomalies, drill down into those anomalies, and prioritize the anomalies for detailed analysis and remediation. By providing a summary representation combined with independent representations of critical parameters, the technique is unique in its ability to aid decision makers in making rapid assessments and prioritization of identified anomalies.

One possible exploitation of this insecure design is the hijacking of IP blocks. Such hijacked IP blocks can then be used to conduct malicious activities from seemingly legitimate IP addresses. In this study we actively trace and monitor the routes to spam sources over several consecutive days after having received a spam message from such a source. However, the real challenge is to distinguish between legitimate routing changes and those ones that are related to systematic misuse in so-called spam campaigns. To combine the strengths of human judgement and computational efficiency, we thus present a novel visual analytics tool named Vistracer in this paper. This tool represents analysis results of our anomaly detection algorithms on large traceroute data sets with the help of several scalable representations to support the analyst to explore, identify and analyze suspicious events and their relations to malicious activities. In particular, pixel-based visualization techniques, novel glyph-based summary representations and a combination of temporal glyphs in a graph representation are used to give an overview of route changes to specific destinations over time. To evaluate our tool, real-world case studies demonstrate the usage of Vistracer in practice on large-scale data sets. Copyright 2012 ACM.",

In this paper, we present an extension to PHPIDS, an open source intrusion detection and prevention system for PHP-based web applications, to visualize its security log. The proposed extension analyzes PHPIDS logs, correlates these logs with the corresponding web server logs, and plots the security-related events. We use a set of tightly coupled visual representations of HTTP server requests containing known and suspicious malicious content, to provide system administrators and security analysts with fine-grained visual-based querying capabilities. We present multiple case studies to demonstrate the ability of our PHPIDS visualization extension to support security analysts with analytic reasoning and decision making in response to ongoing web server attacks. Experimenting the proposed PHPIDS visualization extension on real-world datasets shows promise for providing complementary information for effective situational awareness. Copyright 2013 ACM.",

Our goal is to provide visual support to the analysts as they investigate security alerts for malicious activity within their systems. Our ARL collaborators identified a number of important requirements for any candidate visualization system. These relate to the analyst's mental models and working environment, and to the visualization tool's configurability, accessibility, scalability, and \"fit\" with existing analysis strategies. To meet these requirements, we designed and implement a web-based tool that uses different types of charts as its core representation framework. A JavaScript charting library (RGraph) was extended to provide the interface flexibility and correlation capabilities needed to support analysts as they explore different hypotheses about a potential attack. We describe key elements of our design, explain how an analyst's intent is used to generate different visualizations, and show how the system's interface allows an analyst to rapidly produce a sequence of visualizations to explore specific details about a potential attack as they arise. We conclude with a discussion of plans to further improve the system, and to collect feedback from our ARL colleagues on its strengths and limitations in real-world analysis scenarios.

    "abstract":"As network attacks increase in complexity, the ability to quickly analyze security data and mitigate the effect of these attacks becomes a difficult problem. To alleviate these challenges, researchers are looking into various two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools to detect, identify, and analyze malicious attacks. These visualization tools often require advanced knowledge in networking, visualization, and information security to operate, navigate, and successfully examine malicious attacks. Novice users, deficient in the required advanced knowledge, may find navigation within these visualization tools difficult. Furthermore, expert users may be limited and costly. We discuss the use of a modern recommender system to aid in navigating within a complex 3D visualization for network security applications. We developed a visualization module called NAVSEC, a recommender system prototype for navigating in 3D network security visualization tools. NAVSEC recommends visualizations and interactions to novice users. Given visualization interaction input from a novice user and expert communities, NAVSEC is instrumental in reducing confusion for a novice user while navigating in a 3D visualization. We illustrate NAVSEC with a use-case from an emulated stealthy scanning attack disguised as a file transfer with multiple concurrent connections. We show that using NAVSEC, a novice user's visualization converges towards a visualization used to identify or detect a suspected attack by an expert user. As a result, NAVSEC can successfully guide the novice user in differentiating between complex network attacks and benign legitimate traffic with step-by-step created visualizations and suggested user interactions.

To date, various security mechanisms have been proposed for these networks dealing with either Medium Access Control (MAC) layer or network layer security issues, or key management problems. Security visualization is the latest weapon that has been added in the arsenal of a security officer who is tasked with detecting network anomalies by analyzing large amounts of audit data. This paper proposes a novel security visualization system for analyzing and detecting complex patterns of sensor network attacks, called SRNET. Both selective forwarding and jamming attacks are identified through visualizing and analyzing network traffic data on multiple coordinated views, namely the multidimensional crossed view, the crossed view perspective, and the track area view. Through simulations, we demonstrate that SRNET is able to help detect and further identify the root cause of the aforementioned sensor network attacks. Copyright 2013 ACM.",

Excel and Grep are still the kings of cyber security defense tools; there is a great opportunity to help in this domain, yet many visualizations fall short and are not utilized. In this paper we present seven challenges, informed by two user studies, to be considered when developing a visualization for cyber security purposes.

Most of these samples are not truly unique, but are related through shared attributes. Identifying these attributes can enable analysts to reuse analysis and reduce their workload. Visualizing malware attributes as sets could enable analysts to better understand the similarities and differences between malware. However, existing set visualizations have difficulty displaying hundreds of sets with thousands of elements, and are not designed to compare different types of elements between sets, such as the imported DLLs and callback domains across malware samples. Such analysis might help analysts, for example, to understand if a group of malware samples are behaviorally different or merely changing where they send data. To support comparisons between malware samples' attributes we developed the Similarity Evidence Explorer for Malware (SEEM), a scalable visualization tool for simultaneously comparing a large corpus of malware across multiple sets of attributes (such as the sets of printable strings and function calls). SEEM's novel design breaks down malware attributes into sets of meaningful categories to compare across malware samples, and further incorporates set comparison overviews and dynamic filtering to allow SEEM to scale to hundreds of malware samples while still allowing analysts to compare thousands of attributes between samples. We demonstrate how to use SEEM by analyzing a malware sample from the Mandiant APT1 New York Times intrusion dataset. Furthermore, we describe a user study with five cyber security researchers who used SEEM to rapidly and successfully gain insight into malware after only 15 minutes of training.",

Specifically, IMap groups ASes as contiguous regions based on AS attributes (geolocation, type, rank, IP prefix space) and AS relationships. The area, boundary, and relative positions of these regions in the map do not reect actual world geography, but are determined by the characteristics of the Internet's AS topology.

For example, we find that malware desktop icons are often used to trick users into running malware programs, so identifying groups of related malware samples based on these visual features can highlight themes in the social engineering tactics of today's malware authors. Also, when malware samples share rare images, these image sharing relationships may indicate that the samples were generated or deployed by the same adversaries. To explore and evaluate this malware comparison method, the paper makes two contributions. First, we provide a scalable and intuitive method for computing similarity measurements between malware based on the visual similarity of their sets of images. Second, we give a visualization method that combines a force-directed graph layout with a set visualization technique so as to highlight visual similarity relationships in malware corpora. We evaluate the accuracy of our image set similarity comparison method against a hand curated malware relationship ground truth dataset, finding that our method performs well. We also evaluate our overall concept through a small qualitative study we conducted with three cyber security researchers.

This paper proposes PERCIVAL, a novel visual analytics environment that contributes to situational awareness by allowing the user to understand the network security status and to monitor security events that are happening on the system. The proposed visualization allows for comparing the proactive security analysis with the actual attack progress, providing insights on the effectiveness of the mitigation actions the system has triggered against the attack and giving an overview of the possible attack's evolution. Moreover, the same visualization can be fruitfully used in the proactive analysis since it allows for getting details on computed attack paths and evaluating the mitigation actions that have been proactively computed by the system. A preliminary user study provided a positive feedback on the prototype implementation of the system. A video of the system is available at: https:\/\/youtu.be\/uMpYCJCX95k.",

    "abstract":"© 2015 IEEE. Network security analysis and ensemble data visualization are two active research areas. Although they are treated as separate domains, they share many common challenges and characteristics. Both focus on scalability, time-dependent data analytics, and exploration of patterns and unusual behaviors in large datasets. These overlaps provide an opportunity to apply ensemble visualization research to improve network security analysis. To study this goal, we propose methods to interpret network security alerts and flow traffic as ensemble members. We can then apply ensemble visualization techniques in a network analysis environment to produce a network ensemble visualization system. Including ensemble representations provide new, in-depth insights into relationships between alerts and flow traffic. Analysts can cluster traffic with similar behavior and identify traffic with unusual patterns, something that is difficult to achieve with high-level overviews of large network datasets. Furthermore, our ensemble approach facilitates analysis of relationships between alerts and flow traffic, improves scalability, maintains accessibility and configurability, and is designed to fit our analysts' working environment, mental models, and problem solving strategies.",

In this paper, we focus on how we can support experts in discovering whether anomalies at message level imply a security risk at network level. In SNAPS (Semantic Network traffic Analysis through Projection and Selection), we provide a bottom-up pixel-oriented approach for network traffic analysis where the expert starts with low-level anomalies and iteratively gains insight in higher level events through the creation of multiple selections of interest in parallel. The tight integration between visualization and machine learning enables the expert to iteratively refine anomaly scores, making the approach suitable for both post-traffic analysis and online monitoring tasks. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present example explorations on two real-world data sets for the detection and understanding of potential Advanced Persistent Threats in progress.",

This paper presents a real-time visual analytics system that consists of two essential components: a server for automatically handling data streams and a visual analytics interface for performing interactive analysis. Based on the features of rating frauds, we present a detection solution which balances computationally expensive algorithms and interactive analysis between the server and analysts. Specifically, our detection system filters data through performing an initial suspicion level detection on the server, and analysts can combine different statistical analysis of the user\/item matrix through a co-mapped singular value decomposition (SVD) diagram, re-ordered matrix representation, and the temporal view. We demonstrate our approach with case studies of different fraud scenarios and show that rating frauds can be effectively detected.",

Security analysts therefore require sophisticated tools that allow them to explore and identify user activity that could be indicative of an imminent threat to the organisation. In this work, we discuss the challenges associated with identifying insider threat activity, along with the tools that can help to combat this problem.

The methodology included a survey of subject matter experts to validate that the major findings of prior research on the cognitive work of cyber defenders, conducted over a decade ago, are still valid today. It also utilized a Goal Directed Task Analysis (GDTA) structure to represent the major task, goals, decisions, AQs and data source requirements of early stage cyber incident handlers. This yielded 40 AQs which are reported in this paper. Knowledge Elicitation (KE) interviews of domain practitioners were used to select the AQs with greatest potential for incorporation into a follow-on project to measure the effects of visualization on early stage incident handler performance. The AQs represent measurable units of cognitive work which must be performed using available data in a severely time-constrained work environment. Thus, they can serve as indicators of operator performance to be used in experiments on the effectiveness of visualization for event detection and preliminary analysis. They can also provide requirements for visualization designers and security products.",

However, even with the use of network intrusion detection systems, the number of alerts is still too large to analyze manually. In addition, the discovery of domain-specific multi stage viruses (e.g., Advanced Persistent Threats) are typically not captured by a single alert. The result is that security experts are overloaded with low-level technical alerts where they must look for the presence of an APT. In this paper we propose an alert-oriented visual analytics approach for the exploration of network traffic content in multiple contexts. In our approach CoNTA (Contextual analysis of Network Traffic Alerts), experts are supported to discover threats in large alert collections through interactive exploration using selections and attributes of interest. Tight integration between machine learning and visualization enables experts to quickly drill down into the alert collection and report false alerts back to the intrusion detection system.

In this paper we describe Bigfoot, a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) update visualization system that has been designed to highlight and assess a wide variety of behaviors in update streams. At the core of Bigfoot is the notion of visualizing the announcements of network prefixes via IP geolocation. We investigate different representations of polygons for network footprints and show how straightforward application of IP geolocation can lead to representations that are difficult to interpret. Bigfoot includes techniques to filter, organize, analyze and visualize BGP updates that enable characteristics and behaviors of interest to be identified effectively. To demonstrate Bigfoot's capabilities, we consider 1.79B BGP updates collected over a period of one year and identify 139 candidate events in this data. We investigate a subset of these events in detail, along with ground truth from existing literature to show how network footprint visualizations can be used in operational deployments.",

Thus, the adoption of the resultant cyber-security visualizations is low and this highlights a major research gap. This paper presents expert-interview based validation of EEVi-a model developed to aid in the design and evaluation process of cyber-security visualizations, with a view to make them more effective for cyber-security analysts. A visualization is considered effective if the characteristics of the visualization are essential for an analyst to competently perform a certain task. Thirteen experts were interviewed (six visualization designers and seven cyber-security analysts) and their feedback guided revisions to the model. The responses were subsequently transposed from qualitative data to quantitive data in order to perform statistical analyses on the overall data. This demonstrated that the perspectives of visualization designers and cyber-security analysts generally agreed in their views of effective characteristics for cyber-security visualization, however there was no statistically significant correlation in their responses.",

In this situation, it is possible to involve the user (e.g., the security manager) in the decision loop, presenting him with the details of the decision process in a way he can either be more confident about the system decisions or he can refine what has been done automatically, e.g., promoting an ugly download to a good one.

Unfortunately, such visualizations can inadvertently expose the ostensibly private identities of the persons that make up the dataset. By purposely violating graph readability metrics for a small region of the graph, we conjecture that local, exposed privacy leaks may be perceptually masked from easy recognition. In particular, we consider three commonly known metrics∗edge crossing, node clustering, and node-edge overlapping∗as a strategy to hide leaks. We evaluate the effectiveness of violating these metrics by conducting a user study that measures subject performance at visually searching for and identifying a privacy leak. Results show that when more masking operations are applied, participants needed more time to locate the privacy leak, though exhaustive, brute force search can eventually find it. We suggest future directions on how perceptual masking can be a viable strategy, primarily where modifying the underlying network structure is unfeasible.",

    "abstract":"© 2018 IEEE. This work demonstrates an ongoing effort to employ and explain machine learning model predictions for classifying alerts in Security Operations Centers (SOC). Our ultimate goal is to reduce analyst workload by automating the process of decision making for investigating alerts using the machine learning model in cases where we can completely trust the model. This way, SOC analysts will be able to focus their time and effort to investigate more complex cases of security alerts. To achieve this goal, we developed a system that shows the prediction for an alert and the prediction explanation to security analysts during their daily workflow of investigating individual security alerts. Another part of our system presents the aggregated model analytics to the managers and stakeholders to help them understand the model and decide, on when to trust the model and let the model make the final decision. Using our prediction explanation visualization, security analysts will be able to classify oncoming alerts more efficiently and gain insight into how a machine learning model generates predictions. Our model performance analysis dashboard helps decision makers analyze the model in signature level granularity and gain more insights about the model.",

In this paper, we designed and evaluated visually compressed cyber event sequence (ViC2ES) to assist analysts with building mental models about user activity for Insider Threat Detection. Our visualizations, which show user activity on a daily level, are purpose-built to be embedded in our in-house active learning tool called »CHISSL.» [3], [4] We explored different visual compression techniques with binning or run length encoding, resulting in four unique designs built upon the same icon array presentation. We evaluated these four designs for both low-level and high-level tasks in two experiments: in Experiment I, participants performed perceptual tasks such as selecting the most and least similar activities for each of the designs; in Experiment II, participants used one of the designs in CHISSL for eleven reasoning tasks. The results suggest that participants preferred the high level of aggregation, but made the fewest errors with the low level of aggregation; they were able to interact with CHISSL and accomplish the tasks using both designs. We believe our aggregated designs are effective regarding both task performance and screen space; the high and low levels of aggregation designs are valid for user activity modeling.",

We believe that data reduction and visualization techniques can assist security analysts in studying behavioral patterns in network traffic samples (e.g., PCAP). We argue that the discovery of patterns in this traffic can help us to quickly understand how intrusive behavior such as malware activity unfolds and distinguishes itself from the rest of the traffic.In this paper we present a case study of the visual analytics tool EventPad and illustrate how it is used to gain quick insights in the analysis of PCAP traffic using rules, aggregations, and selections.

Such dashboards can assist the analyst to understand the data at hand and, consequently, to conceive more targeted preemption and mitigation security strategies. Despite the recent advances, model-based security analysis is lacking tools that employ effective dashboards∗to manage potential attack vectors, system components, and requirements. This problem is further exacerbated because model-based security analysis produces significantly larger result spaces than security analysis applied to realized systems∗where platform specific information, software versions, and system element dependencies are known. Therefore, there is a need to manage the analysis complexity in model-based security through better visualization techniques. Towards that goal, we propose an interactive security analysis dashboard that provides different views largely centered around the system, its requirements, and its associated attack vector space. This tool makes it possible to start analysis earlier in the system lifecycle. We apply this tool in a significant area of engineering design∗the design of cyber-physical systems∗where security violations can lead to safety hazards.",

Testing systems for ROP-based attacks can be valuable for improving the security and reliability of software. In this paper, we propose ROPMATE, the first Visual Analytics system specifically designed to assist human red team ROP exploit builders. In contrast, previous ROP tools typically require users to inspect a puzzle of hundreds or thousands of lines of textual information, making it a daunting task. ROPMATE presents builders with a clear interface of well-defined and semantically meaningful gadgets, i.e., fragments of code already present in the binary application that can be chained to form fully-functional exploits. The system supports incrementally building exploits by suggesting gadget candidates filtered according to constraints on preserved registers and accessed memory. Several visual aids are offered to identify suitable gadgets and assemble them into semantically correct chains. We report on a preliminary user study that shows how ROPMATE can assist users in building ROP chains.",

Traditional query analysis is performed packet by packet, lacking global, temporal, and visual coherence, obscuring latent trends and clusters. Our approach leverages the pattern recognition and computational power of deep learning with 2D and 3D rendering techniques for quick and easy interpretation and interaction with vast amount of root DNS network traffic. Working with real-world DNS experts, our visualization reveals several surprising latent clusters of queries, potentially malicious and benign, discovers previously unknown characteristics of a real-world root DNS DDOS attack, and uncovers unforeseen changes in the distribution of queries received over time. These discoveries will provide DNS analysts with a deeper understanding of the nature of the DNS traffic under their charge, which will help them safeguard the root DNS against future attack.",

In the past visual analytics approaches aimed at detecting these phenomenons but only a few of these integrated geographical references. Geo-IP data is being used mostly as a lookup table which is an undervaluation of its capabilities. In this paper we present a visual-interactive system which only relies on Geo-IP data to create more awareness for this data source. We show that looking at Geo-IP data over time in combination with owner and location information of IP blocks already reveals suspicious cases. Together with our design study we also contribute a pre-processing algorithm for the Maxmind GeoIP2 City and ISP databases, to motivate the community to integrate this data source in future approaches.",

We pair the output of this algorithm with aggregation summary tables that give users information scent about which detections are worth investigating based on the metadata of the log events rather than the periodic signal. A visualization of selected detections enables users to see all detected period lengths per entity, and compare detections between entities to check for coordinated activity. We evaluate our approach on real-world netflow and DNS data from a large organization, demonstrating how to successfully find malicious periodic activity in a large pool of noise and non-malicious periodic activity.",

Traditional sequential and timeline based method cannot easily address the complexity of temporal and relational features of user behaviors. We propose a map-based visual metaphor and create an interactive map for encoding user behaviors. It enables analysts to explore and identify user behavior patterns and helps them to understand why some behaviors are regarded as anomalous. We experiment with a real dataset containing multiple user sessions, consisting of sequences of diverse types of actions. In the behavior map, we encode an action as a city and user sessions as trajectories going through the cities. The position of the cities is determined by the sequential and temporal relationship of actions. Spatial and temporal patterns on the map reflect behavior patterns in the action space. In the case study, we illustrate how we explore relationships between actions, identify patterns of the typical session and detect anomaly behaviors.",

Operation technology networks, i.e. hard- and software used for monitoring and controlling physical\/industrial processes, have been considered immune to cyber attacks for a long time. A recent increase of attacks in these networks proves this assumption wrong. Several technical constraints lead to approaches to detect attacks on industrial processes using available sensor data. This setting differs fundamentally from anomaly detection in IT-network traffic and requires new visualization approaches adapted to the common periodical behavior in OT-network data. We present a tailored visualization system that utilizes inherent features of measurements from industrial processes to full capacity to provide insight into the data and support triage analysis by laymen and experts. The novel combination of spiral plots with results from anomaly detection was implemented in an interactive system. The capabilities of our system are demonstrated using sensor and actuator data from a real-world water treatment process with introduced attacks. Exemplary analysis strategies are presented. Finally, we evaluate effectiveness and usability of our system and perform an expert evaluation.",
